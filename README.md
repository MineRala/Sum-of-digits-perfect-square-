# Sum-of-digits-perfect-square-
Write a program that reads an integer from the user (keyboard), namely n. Your
program should print all positive numbers that are smaller than n and satisfy the
following condition: If we denote the number with a and sum of its digits b then
a+b is a perfect square. You should print the numbers in ascending order and print
their digits separated by “-“ symbol from the least significant to the most
significant on the same line as the number. At the end of each line you should also
print a+b.
